To create a simple service worker that makes your web app available offline, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Service Worker File: Create a new JavaScript file named "service-worker.js" in your project directory. This file will contain the code for your service worker.

2. Register the Service Worker: In your main JavaScript file (usually index.js or app.js), add the following code to register the service worker:


`
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');
}
`

3. Install and Cache Assets: In your "service-worker.js" file, add the following code to install the service worker and cache your app's assets:


`
self.addEventListener('install', event => {
event.waitUntil(
caches.open('my-app-cache')
.then(cache => {
return cache.addAll([
'/',
'/index.html',
'/app.js',
'/styles.css',
// Add other files you want to cache here
]);
})
);
});
`


4. Serve from Cache: Add the following code to your "service-worker.js" file to intercept fetch requests and serve the cached assets:

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
event.respondWith(
caches.match(event.request)
.then(response => {
if (response) {
return response;
}
return fetch(event.request);
})
);
});

5. Update Cache: If you update your app's files, you'll need to update the cached assets as well. Add the following code to your "service-worker.js" file to handle cache updates:

self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
event.waitUntil(
caches.keys()
.then(keys => {
return Promise.all(
keys.map(key => {
if (key !== 'my-app-cache') {
return caches.delete(key);
}
})
)
})
);
});
6. Test Offline Mode: To test your offline functionality, open your app in a browser that supports service workers (like Chrome or Firefox). Once the service worker is installed, you can close and reopen the browser, or even disconnect from the internet, and your app should still load and function properly.
